							This consists of attacking a fictitious environment, in order to obtain administrator access or a file that is normally inaccessible. Each time it is a real challenge, and I always discover new tools and new vulnerabilities. I hope one day to use this knowledge to secure a real system.

						<p class="h-6 justify">
							I discovered video games thanks to my older brother when I was 6 years old. He made me discover universes that fascinated me. This medium allows you to create all the stories you want, to convey a lot of emotions. I met people who are now friends on some online games, with who I have unforgettable memories.

						<p class="h-6 justify">
							I played a lot of different sports when I was a teenager (tennis, basketball, American football...). For the past 1.5 years I have been playing badminton with the university. It's a good way to relieve the stress of the week, and to let off steam. Even if I don't play at a competitive level, I like to confront other players to improve myself.
